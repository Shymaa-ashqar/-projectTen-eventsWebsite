Jordanâ€™s Dead Sea coast is one of the most spectacular natural and spiritual landscapes in the world, and it remains as enticing tointernational visitors today as it was to kings, emperors, traders, and prophets in antiquity. The main attraction of the Dead Sea is of course the soothing, abnormally salty water itself. The salt content of the water is 31.5% making the water so buoyant that it is impossible for the visitor to sink. The water also contains 21 minerals including high levels of magnesium, sodium, potassium, and bromine and 12 of these minerals are found in no other body of water in the world. Studies have shown the combination of the Dead Sea water and the rich black mud found along the shoreline to have significant health benefits including increasing circulation, easing discomfort from arthritis, healing allergies, and revitalizing skin',

                Located approximately three hours south of Amman, Petra is the legacy of the Nabataeans, an industrious Arab people who settled
                 in southern Jordan more than 2,000 years ago. Admired then for its refined culture, massive architecture and ingenious complex 
                 of dams and water channels, Petra is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site that enchants visitors from all corners of the globe.
                  Much of Petra appeal comes from its spectacular setting deep inside a narrow desert gorge.
                 The site is accessed by walking through a kilometre long chasm (or siq), the walls of which soar 200m upwards',
